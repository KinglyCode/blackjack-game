# Hello and Welcome to my really simple Blackjack game!

# Project BlackJack

Like I said above, this is a truly simple game of BlackJack. There's no double down or splitting cards, not even points or betting. This was just a little project and my first time coding a full game with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

If you haven't played BlackJack, it's just a simple numbers game. You have to beat the dealer. You have to try to get more numbers than the dealer or hope the dealers busts (has more than 21) and you win! Of course, if you're not careful, you can bust and lose as well!

The game just sets up the player with the dealer. Dealer is played by the Computer itself! 

# Here are some screenshots of the game!

NOTE: If you want to restart the game, refresh the page!

Other than the note above, have fun, it works as intended.

# Future Updates

I will be coming back to this project to add more functionality to it, like a Reset button, adding the sums up and showing up on the page for the viewer to see. Thinking I might have to add things like doubling down and splitting cards!

Other than that, please enjoy this small game!
