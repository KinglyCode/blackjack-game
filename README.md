# Hello and Welcome to my really simple Blackjack game!

# Project BlackJack

Like I said above, this is a truly simple game of BlackJack. There's no double down or splitting cards, not even points or betting. This was just a little project and my first time coding a full game with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

If you haven't played BlackJack, it's just a simple numbers game. You have to beat the dealer. You have to try to get more numbers than the dealer or hope the dealers busts (has more than 21) and you win! Of course, if you're not careful, you can bust and lose as well!

The game just sets up the player with the dealer. Dealer is played by the Computer itself!
